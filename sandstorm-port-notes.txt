The main change here is to merge a static content server into the websocket server.

I could not get the code built by bin/build.sh to work. Instead, I just serve the raw source code:
$ cd client
$ cp -r ../shared .


I followed these instructions to populate client/audio/music:

Known issues:

The displated number of players is not always exactly correct or consistent.
I suspect this has to do with the fact that we configure "metrics_enabled = false".
Enabling metrics runs into other problems, though.
